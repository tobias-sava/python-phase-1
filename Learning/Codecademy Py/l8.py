# 12/12/2024 - codecademy practice "parameters and arguments"

# i already know a bit about functions but this is a good recap

# creating program that generates directions for user trips

# creating trip instruction function

def generate_trip_instructions(location):
    print("Looks like you are planning a trip to visit " + location)

generate_trip_instructions("Central Park")

# ok nevermind that was literally the whole exercise ...

# next lesson - multiple parameters

# had to do it on codecademy because i need to use their on-site IDE ...

# built in functions vs user defined functions lesson got me thinking.
# i now feel like i understand functions better :)

# code from codecademy exercise below

tshirt_price = 9.75
shorts_price = 15.50
mug_price = 5.99
poster_price = 2.00

# Write your code below:

# Checkpoint 1
max_price = max(tshirt_price, shorts_price, mug_price, poster_price)
print(max_price)

# Checkpoint 2
min_price = min(tshirt_price, shorts_price, mug_price, poster_price)
print(min_price)

# Checkpoint 3
rounded_price = round(tshirt_price, 1)
print(rounded_price)
